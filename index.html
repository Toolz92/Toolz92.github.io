                        I am seeking a full-time permanent or contract position in game programming in the GTA. I have several years of game programming experience in multiple areas such as mobile, PC, and console.
						I recently graduated from the Game Programming program at George Brown College with an Advanced Diploma. I have been studying coding at a post-secondary level  for five years, with my main focus being C++,C#, and Python. My program prepared me for a variety of programming applications, including mobile, VR, console, and PC. 
						<br>
						While in school, I also was selected to work as a programmer with an in-house game studio; our game was shown at the 2019 Level Up competition and was well-received by the judges. This opportunity allowed me to gain experience programming in a professional team setting. This was a practical and professional experience where I was able to improve my programming skills in a team context. I am passionate about making and playing video games and I aspire to make awesome games with an awesome game company!

                <h3>Nocturnal Knights</h3>
                <h4>Programmer</h4>
                <p>
                   	Nocturnal Knights was a in house studio at George Brown College run by the program head and managed by Game Design Grad students. Due to my success in my other classes I was selected 
                   	to work with them as a programmer to build a game that would be shown off at the 2019 LevelUp Showcase. I worked there for 6 months while taking my other classes and build many different game systems, including the games online functionalities. This was a very agile environment, with standup strum meetings taking place every week to asses where the game was at and what still needed to be done or abandoned. I believe this possition has given me a good understanding of agile development and game industry workflow.

            <h4>Advanced Diploma in Game Prgramming</h4>
            <p>
                This program was much more suited towards my interests focusing solely on making games. The course structure ensured I was always making at least one game, but often more, for verious classes, both in groups and solo. These game verried wildly in scope and design, showing me many different aproaches and style of game development. The tools I used varried as well, while most of the courses were taught using Unity, many used Ureal Engine 3, with others pure C++, and one having me build my own engine. I developed for many platforms, several of my classes's grades were dependent on wether or not my game was accepted onto a storefront, and as a result I have successfully published games on the Google Play Store, App Store, and Windows Store. My Xbox game published on the windows store got 200 downloads in the first week, well over triple that of my next highest classmates.

                   I began my post-secondary education at the University of Guelph, persuing a degree in software engineering. Durring my time there I was taught lower level programing such as C and even Assembly. Many of my courses focused on software develpment workflow and development cycles, teaching the ways of the waterfall method and then showing us all its demons and praseing the savior that is the agile method. I had the oppertuniy to take several elective while there covering a wide array of topics, from advanced maths to histories and laguages. However durring my time at Guelph I always felt that game development was where I wanted to end up, and upon seeing the courses offed take me deeper into the theoretical programming space I made the desision to transfer to George Brown College to persue Game Programming.

                            This is the game I helped develope at Nocturnal Knights. It is a two player third-person assometrical game of cat and mouse. With one player acting as a detective trying to solve the mysteries of the manor, and the other acting as the ghost attempting to drive the detective insane. The detective must search the house looking for evidence and once 5 pieces have been found head towards the final alter to banish the ghost. The ghost must drive off the detective by getting close enoguh to the detective to drain his sainty, and the ghost must drain all the sanity before the detetive can accomplish his goal. Both players have a veriety of resaurces and tools to hinder the other, such as locking doors or placing repelling wards.

                            This is a project I worked on over the summer burring breaks in my regular job. I wanted to challenge myself to only use what I knew (so no googling) and assets already on my computer, hence the heavy use of flappy bird assets. Flappy Bullet is a top down shoot'em'up with enemies coming towards you from the top of the screen. This project was fun to make as it pushed my creativity and problem solving with a time limit, as well as gave me a chance to try out asset creation, all the assets that arent from flappy bird are created by me in a pixel art creator.

                            Built in Unreal Engine 3, the goal of this project was to create a 2D brawler in the same vien as Streets of Rage. With that gameplay consept in mind we created a short, 2-player demo packed with 3 playable charecters, 3 enemie types, and 3 levels to play through.This project was graded based on if it was accepted to be published through the ID@Xbox system, and so it required much stricter coding and manditory Xbox functionality support, such as gamertags. At the end of the course it was submited for publication and was accepted. It gained over 200 downloads in its first week and many possitve reviews
